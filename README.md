## Calum Wilmot

I'm a calm, positive and dedicated software developer with a strong inclination towards teamwork and collective problem solving. My pre-coding background is in the music industry, as both a performer and manager, and I'm fluent in Spanish and advanced in French thanks to my languages degree. Having experienced first hand the degree to which tech both serves and defines a supposedly creative sector such as music, I am unbelievably excited to explore the different ways I can play a part in the increasing influence of tech in our day-to-day.

## Work Experience

**Crosstalk Management** (August 2018 to April 2020)  
Artist Manager

- I acted as an ambassador for the artists with whom I worked when dealing with industry professionals. This involved:
  - Strategy - This entailed formulating release plans, advising business decisions and facilitiing the booking of shows       and tours.
  - Communication - Given the wide variety of individuals my role required I interact with, I developed clear, concise         and solution-oriented communication
  

**Wimbledon Tennis Championships** (2016 to 2017)  
Day Housekeeper at Centrecourt

- Working collaboratively on a project - It was necessary to maintain regular contact to keep track of what each member of   the team had done, thus allowing us to work effectively by building on each other's work.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

**Communication
I have extensive experience communicating complex information quickly and accurately in a variety of contexts. For example, my time spent studying French and Spanish at the University of Southampton necessitated a high degree of collaboration with other students and delegation of tasks. As well as this, it required the ability to have difficult conversations, a skill demonstrated during my time conducting an ethnographic research project in Spain on the relevance of the Spanish Catholic Church to youth identity. Given the sensitive and potentially controversial nature of the reserach, I was requiredd to be sensitive but direct about several difficult topics. Despite these potential pitfalls, the studies were completed without incident, with the valuable informaiton proving crucial in the completion of my study.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (12/9/22 - 2/12/22)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Southampton  (September 2014 - June 2020)

- French and Spanish

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person
