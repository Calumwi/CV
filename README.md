## Calum Wilmot

I'm a calm, positive and dedicated software developer with a strong inclination towards teamwork and collective problem solving. Having previously worked in the music industry as both a performer and manager, as well as studying languages at University, thanks to which I'm fluent in Spanish and French, I have now completed the Makers bootcamp and decided to pursue a career in tech. I am incredibly eager to investigate the various ways I may contribute to the growing influence of technology in our daily lives after seeing first hand how much it both supports and defines a creative industry like music, or sport, my other great passion. Be it through growing fanbases via streaming and social media services through to building bespoke websites for local rugby clubs that would previously have had to rely on word of mouth, tech's potential to unite people and enhance their lives is nigh on boundless and I want more than anything to play a part in that change.

## Work Experience

**Crosstalk MGMT** (August 2018 to April 2020)  
Artist Manager

  I acted as an ambassador for the artists with whom I worked when dealing with industry professionals. This involved:
   - Strategy - I used my extensive industry experience to help-formulate release plans, advise business decisions and facilitate the booking of shows and      tours within the context of the wider mission statement that was to develop the band while minimising the personal incurred by the members as              individuals.
   - Communication - I developed clear, concise and solution-oriented communication with a wide variety of individuals representing local and global            companies.
   - People management - Although I was involved in negotiating with external businesses in my day-to-day, there were cases which required to me to spend        more time managing individuals. This become particularly crucial when there were large egos involved, and I had to constantly find new find ways to        maintain motivation amongst the artists I was working with.
   

**Next** (2016 to 2017)
Sales Associate
  
  Here, my roles included:
   - Logistics - Stock-taking, working to KPI's and deadlines. 
   - Dealing with customers - My role was to represent the company while engaging with customers on the shop floor, ensuring that their needs were              understood and met quickly.
   - Time management - Each task had to be completed in the shortest possible time to ensure my understaffed colleagues were not overwhelmed during rushes.

**Fever-Tree** (2017)
Bar Staff

While working at Fever-Tree, among my duties were:
   - Working under pressure - My work for Fever-Tree took place exclusively at pop-bars at international cricket events, and as such my team and I were          constantly subjected to rushes surrounding half time and breaks and start of play. Because of this, it was crucial that I work quickly and efficently,      often with intoxicated and abusive customers, to ensure that the Fever-Tree clientelle were satisfied.


**Wimbledon Tennis Championships** (2015 and 2017)  
Day Housekeeper at Centrecourt

 During my time at Wimbledon, I found myself using skills such as:
  - Time management - The cleaning rota for each area had to be updated every 30 minutes and were checked every hour by my team leader. To ensure I didn't     behind, I had to develop time allowances for each area and stick to them rigidly.


## Skills


**Communication**

- I have extensive experience communicating complex information quickly and accurately in a variety of contexts.
- For example, my time spent studying French and Spanish at University necessitated a high degree of collaboration with other students and delegation of tasks.
- It also required the ability to have difficult conversations, a skill demonstrated during my time conducting an ethnographic research project while living in Spain on the relevance of the Spanish Catholic Church to youth identity. 
- Given the sensitive and potentially controversial nature of the research, I was required to be sensitive but direct about several difficult topics.
- Despite these potential pitfalls, the studies were completed without incident, with the valuable information proving crucial in the completion of my project.

**Teamwork**

- I particularly enjoy working as part of a team. Be it as part of an artist management team, such as at Crosstalk MGMT, all the way back to my rugby career when I was fortunate enough to play around the world, I have always thrived in team environments.
- This collaborative instinct was especially useful during my studies at Makers Academy, where 50% of the course was spent in self-governed groups tackling extended projects. 
- In one of these groups, I spent time as a team leader, allocating tickets, scheduling the day and leading stand-ups and retros. In doing this, I helped create a culture of knowledge-sharing between the different pairs working on various branches of the project. 
- This was to avoid people falling behind as well as ensuring that the less vocal members of the team were heard and maintained investment in the work we were doing. 
- It also was crucial in the daily pair programming sessions that formed part of the Makers course, during which time we would take turns to 'drive' and 'navigate' in order to get practie both coding and guiding other coders. 
- In the future, I would love to have the opportunity to mentor new developers and help my team thrive.

**Adaptability**

- The initial unfamiliarity of the content and the speed at which I had to learn it meant that I frequently had to adapt to new concepts and codebases, finding ways to be productive while acclimatizing to the new material (e.g. covering Ruby, JavaScript and a host of complementary technologies over the space of 3 months). 
- This was demonstrated when working on the Ruffians BnB project, where we dropped into a preexisting codebase with a MERN tech stack (Mongo DB, Express, React, Node).
- At the time, these were unknown technologies to our group, and as such we had to pivot and learn what we could while trying to begin to interact the with the code.
- To combat this uncertainty, we agreed to adhere to Agile team-working practices far more rigidly than than in the past, priotising knowledge-sharing at standups to ensure that nobody fell behind.
- As a result, we ended up with a functioning product that we were proud to submit.
