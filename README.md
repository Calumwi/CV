## Calum Wilmot

I'm a calm, positive and dedicated software developer with a strong inclination towards teamwork and collective problem solving. My pre-coding background is in the music industry, as both a performer and manager, and I'm fluent in Spanish and French. I am incredibly eager to investigate the various ways I may contribute to the growing influence of technology in our daily lives after seeing first hand how much it both supports and defines a creative industry like music.

## Skills


**Communication**

I have extensive experience communicating complex information quickly and accurately in a variety of contexts. For example, my time spent studying French and Spanish at University necessitated a high degree of collaboration with other students and delegation of tasks. It also required the ability to have difficult conversations, a skill demonstrated during my time conducting an ethnographic research project while living in Spain on the relevance of the Spanish Catholic Church to youth identity. Given the sensitive and potentially controversial nature of the research, I was required to be sensitive but direct about several difficult topics. Despite these potential pitfalls, the studies were completed without incident, with the valuable information proving crucial in the completion of my project.

**Teamwork**

I particularly enjoy working as part of a team. Be it as part of an artist management team, such as at Crosstalk MGMT, all the way back to my rugby career when I was fortunate enough to play around the world, I have always thrived in team environments. This collaborative instinct was especially useful during my studies at Makers Academy, where 50% of the course was spent in self-governed groups tackling extended projects. In one of these groups, I spent time as a team leader, allocating tickets, scheduling the day and leading stand-ups and retros. In doing this, I helped create a culture of knowledge-sharing between the different pairs working on various branches of the project. This was to avoid people falling behind as well as ensuring that the less vocal members of the team were heard and maintained investment in the work we were doing. In the future, I would love to have the opportunity to mentor new developers and help my team thrive.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (12/9/22 - 2/12/22)

My time at Makers was characterised by periods of intensive solo learning, daily pair programming sessions and longer-form group projects. The initial  unfamiliarity of the content and the speed at which I had to learn it meant that I frequently had to adapt to new concepts and codebases, finding ways to be productive while acclimatizing to the new material (e.g. covering Ruby, JavaScript, Node, Rspec, SQL, HTML, CSS, React, Mongo DB, Firebase and more over the space of 3 months). This was demonstrated when working on the Ruffians BnB project, where we dropped into a preexisting codebase with a MERN tech stack (Mongo DB, Express, React, Node). At the time, this was completely unfamiliar technology to the group, and as such we had to pivot and learn what we could while trying to begin to interact the with the code. To combat this uncertainty, we agreed to adhere to Agile team-working practices far more rigidly than than in the past, priotising knowledge-sharing at standups to ensure that nobody fell behind. As a result, we ended up with a functioning product that we were proud to submit.


#### University of Southampton  (September 2014 - June 2020)

- French and Spanish
- 2:1 Honours
- I ended my degree fluent in French and Spanish having spent a year living in Alicante


## Hobbies

In my spare time, I enjoy weight-lifting and playing guitar. I have a black belt in Karate, I played County level rugby and I have a metal band which has over 10,000,000 Spotify streams.
